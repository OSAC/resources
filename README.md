# Open Source Club Resources 

This is the one stop shop for any project resource. This repository includes links to guides on various topics, templates for quickly setting up a project, coding guidelines for various languages, and other useful info. 

## Getting Started

For an introduction to the club, [click here](introduction.md).

The [resources](resources/) folder is divided into different technologies. Though most will be a single file with a short explanation and links, things with more information will have their own folder.

You can copy the [project-template](project-template/) folder to get up and running with a new project quickly. Check the [explanation.md](https://github.com/ufosc/resources/project-template/explanation.md) inside the directory for a more detailed explanation of what's all included. Be sure to remove this once it's all set up. 

The [coding-guidelines](coding-guidelines/) has a set of general guidelines for each language. Each project is free to adjust these, so check there for specifics. There is also a [best-practices.md](https://github.com/ufosc/resources/coding-guidelines/best-practices.md) that goes over good language agnostic coding practices. 

Finally, there is a [presentation folder](presentations/) that holds links to past presentations.
